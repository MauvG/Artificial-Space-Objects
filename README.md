# Artificial-Space-Objects
This was a group Project for College
The goal of this project was to construct an application to explore data relating to artificial space objects, such as satellites and debris.
We used a public data set called the General Catalog of Artificial Space objects.
Then we rendered the program so we could visual the data using a program called Processing.
I implemented the scroll page feature which was used in every page.
I also implemented the last which allowed the user to see extra detail about a specific satellite.
